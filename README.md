# Neighborhood Map Project

An app shows a map of Los Gatos, CA with bakeries & dessert locations. These locations can be filtered, and when the marker or name in the list is clicked, information about it pops up. The info window will show the name, location, phone number, address and rating!

This app also has a server to handle back-end requests. The server will run on http://localhost:9000

1. Clone the repo and open index.html in your favorite browser.
2. In Terminal, run node index.js or nodemon index.js to run the server
